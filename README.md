Package and Imports:
<hr>
package main: This is the entry point for your Go program.
import ...: These lines import necessary packages for HTTP server functionality, JSON encoding, sorting, and time measurement.
Port Definition:

const port = 8000: Defines the port on which the server will listen for incoming requests.
Main Function:
<hr>
func main() {...}: This function is the main entry point for your program.
http.HandleFunc(...): Register handler functions for each endpoint (/process-single and /process-concurrent).
fmt.Printf(...): Prints a message indicating the server is listening on the specified port.
http.ListenAndServe(...): Starts the server and listens for incoming requests.
Request and Response Structures:

type request: Defines the structure of the JSON request with a field ToSort containing an array of sub-arrays to be sorted.
type response: Defines the structure of the JSON response with fields for the sorted arrays and the execution time in nanoseconds.
Sequential Processing (processSingle):
<hr>
var req request: Declares a variable of type request to store the decoded JSON body.
json.NewDecoder(...).Decode(...): Decodes the request body into the req variable.
if err != nil {...}: Handles any errors during decoding.
startTime := time.Now(): Records the start time for performance measurement.
for _, subArr := range req.ToSort {...}: Iterates through each sub-array in the req.ToSort field.
sort.Ints(subArr): Sorts the current sub-array in-place using the standard library's sort.Ints function.
endTime := time.Now(): Records the end time for performance measurement.
resp := response{...}: Builds a response object with the sorted arrays and calculated execution time.
json.NewEncoder(...).Encode(resp): Encodes the response object as JSON and writes it to the response body.
Concurrent Processing (processConcurrent):
<hr>
Similar structure to processSingle until the "Collect sorted sub-arrays from channel" section.
// for i := range req.ToSort {...}: Commented-out code that originally appended received sub-arrays from the channel directly.
var channelCount = len(req.ToSort): Stores the number of sub-arrays for later loop usage.
for range req.ToSort {...}: Iterates through each sub-array, utilizing the pre-stored channelCount for efficiency.
copy(sortedArrays, sortedArrays[:channelCount]): Shifts existing elements within the sortedArrays slice without reallocation.
sortedArrays = append(sortedArrays, <-sortedChannel): Appends the received sorted sub-array from the channel.
This alternative approach avoids repeated appending and improves memory efficiency compared to the commented-out loop.<hr>
